Project Title:
COVID-19 Regional Impact Analysis Using Tableau

Description:
This project is a data visualization case study aimed at analyzing the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using Tableau. Leveraging real-world COVID-19 datasets sourced from "Our World in Data", the project focuses on understanding how the virus affected different regions, normalized by population metrics. The final output is an interactive Tableau dashboard that helps users visually explore infection and death statistics by country or region using map visuals, KPI cards, and per capita metrics.

The dashboard was built to serve both data professionals and the general public, making complex data more digestible through intuitive charts and interactivity. Data was initially processed and cleaned using Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability in Tableau.

This project demonstrates key skills in:

Data wrangling and preprocessing
Calculating and visualizing per capita rates
Designing visually effective dashboards
Communicating insights clearly through data stories

# 📊 COVID-19 Regional Impact Analysis (Tableau Project)

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built to explore the global spread and impact of COVID-19. The goal is to compare infection and death rates across regions while normalizing for population size. It’s designed to help both analysts and non-technical users gain insights into the pandemic’s geographic footprint.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using a curated COVID-19 dataset from *Our World in Data*, this dashboard visualizes the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, and population-adjusted metrics for multiple regions. By leveraging map-based visuals and interactive controls, users can:
- Identify hotspots across countries
- Compare pandemic outcomes by population
- Understand which regions were most heavily affected per million residents
